<h1>Curator</h1>

<h4>Curator is an app that allows the user to save their favorite restaurants or save a newly discovered restaurant while they are at the restaurant.</h4>

<h4> In the next three gifs, you will see how the user can see his location using a pin on the map and be able to type in the restaurant name and have it saved
 into a list of favorite restaurants. They can rate the restaurant, save what they ate, a picture, as well as any other notes.</h4>
